## Implementation of Tupper's self-referential formula

### More on Tupper's formula:
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper%27s_self-referential_formula)
- [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s5RFgd59ao)

It does not actually use Tupper's formula per se. 
First I have decoded it on paper and then I implemented decoding and encoding algorithms instead of calculating inequality, because reading binary data is quicker, than this direct and clever calculations.
